# Final-Face-Detection-with-OpenCV-and-Haar-Cascades
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier. It captures video from the webcam, flips the feed horizontally, and highlights detected faces with rectangles.  Usage Run python face_detection.py to start. Press 'q' to exit.
